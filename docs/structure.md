# High-level sequencing advice (what to run when)

1. **Lock the folder & file contract**: Mermaid + JSON Schema. Why: avoid drift when agents generate Markdown files.
2. **Generate canonical `profile.md` templates**: single source of truth per role. Why: easy human review, agent-friendly.
3. **Optional enrichment**: allow agent to do targeted web search to expand sections (tools, frameworks, market practices). Why: avoid shallow clich√©s.
4. **Iterate via agent**: mass-generate role profiles, cross-link them, derive artifacts like runbooks or checklists. Why: scalable once the format is stable.

If I had to start right now: I‚Äôd lock the **Markdown schema & folder convention**.

---

# Step A ‚Äî Folder + file convention

Use `/crew-blueprint/roles/<slug>/profile.md` as canonical.
Each profile is Markdown-first, structured with YAML frontmatter. Example:

```markdown
---
id: de-01
slug: data-engineer
name: Data Engineer
default_seniority: Senior
---

# Mission
Deliver reliable, observable, and cost-efficient data pipelines that power analytics and ML.

# Short Description
Builds and maintains data ingestion, transformation and delivery systems.

# Properties
- Preferred Tech: airflow, dbt, kafka, postgres
- Workstyle: infrastructure-first

# Responsibilities
- **Data pipeline design & implementation** (primary)  
  *Success metric*: <1h latency, 99.9% freshness  
- **Data quality and monitoring**

# Capabilities
- SQL ‚Äî advanced  
- Distributed systems design ‚Äî competent

# Artifacts
- Curated datasets (dataset)

# Interactions
- Delivers dataset ‚Üí Data Analyst (daily)  
  Notes: contract fields agreed via schema docs
```

This keeps humans in the loop (Markdown), while still being structured (frontmatter).

---

# Step B ‚Äî JSON Schema for validation

Instead of YAML, validate the **frontmatter block**. Everything below is freeform Markdown, but sections should follow fixed headers (`# Mission`, `# Responsibilities`, etc.).

The schema just checks the frontmatter keys:

```json
{
  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
  "title": "RoleProfileFrontmatter",
  "type": "object",
  "required": ["id", "slug", "name", "default_seniority"],
  "properties": {
    "id": { "type": "string", "pattern": "^[a-z0-9\\-]+$" },
    "slug": { "type": "string" },
    "name": { "type": "string" },
    "default_seniority": { "type": "string", "enum": ["Junior","Mid","Senior","Staff","Principal"] }
  }
}
```

---

# Step C ‚Äî Agent generation pipeline (Markdown-first)

1. Agent takes role slug list (`data-engineer`, `frontend-engineer`, ‚Ä¶).
2. For each: generate `profile.md` with required sections.
3. Validate frontmatter against schema.
4. Optionally: enrich responsibilities/capabilities with web search (e.g., ‚Äúcurrent best practices for data engineers 2025‚Äù).
5. Write to repo under `/roles/<slug>/profile.md`.

---

# Step D ‚Äî Optional cross-artifacts

Once roles exist:

* **Crew Map**: Mermaid diagram linking slugs, drawn automatically from `interactions` section.
* **Index.md**: Table of contents with links and short descriptions.
* **Runbooks.md**: Derived from responsibilities tagged as ‚Äúprimary‚Äù.

---

# Copilot orientation (direct copy for your agent)

* Repo root slug: `crew-blueprint`.
* For each role slug:

  * Generate `roles/<slug>/profile.md`.
  * Use YAML frontmatter + fixed headers contract.
  * Validate frontmatter with JSON Schema.
  * Do not commit invalid profiles.
* On enrichment: if section feels too generic, trigger targeted web search (e.g., ‚Äútop monitoring responsibilities for SRE 2025‚Äù). Insert citations inline.
* Always produce a `SUMMARY.md` report with role count, validation results, and unresolved TODOs.

---

# Failure modes & mitigations

* **Markdown drift**: roles use inconsistent headers ‚Üí enforce fixed header order.
* **Shallow text**: agent overuses ‚Äúresponsible for X‚Äù ‚Üí enforce ‚Äú1 sentence, measurable verb‚Äù rule.
* **Redundancy**: multiple roles duplicate responsibilities ‚Üí flag duplicates in summary.
* **Internet hallucinations**: require inline links/citations for any web-derived content.

## üîë Layered view of the model

1. **Conceptual Layer**
   What you wrote: Role, Responsibility, Capability, Artifact, Interaction, Seniority, etc.
   ‚Üí Think of this as the ‚Äúrole grammar‚Äù: the set of entities you can always rely on.

2. **Canonical Representation Layer**
   Decide the ‚Äúsource of truth‚Äù:

   * **YAML frontmatter + Markdown body** per role (human-first, flexible).
   * **Schema validation** with JSON Schema (machine guardrails).
   * Keep SQL DDL as *target sink*, not the source (avoid double maintenance).

3. **Working Artifact Layer**
   Folder structure you outlined:

   ```
   crew/<role-slug>/
     profile.md / profile.yaml
     responsibilities/*.md
     capabilities/*.md
     artifacts/*.md
   ```

   ‚Üí This lets you treat each role folder as a **knowledge capsule**.

4. **Enrichment Layer (optional)**

   * Agent web search: best practices, modern frameworks, example artifacts.
   * Derived artifacts: Mermaid diagrams, checklists, onboarding guides.
   * Summaries: cross-role index, crew map, seniority ladders.

---

## üìê Modeling principles to preserve

* **Roles are not people** (avoid slipping into ‚ÄúAlice the Backend Engineer‚Äù).
* **Responsibilities are reusable**: don‚Äôt bake them too hard into a single role.
* **Interactions are typed edges**: model them like verbs, not just lines (‚Äúdelivers dataset‚Äù, ‚Äúadvises‚Äù).
* **Artifacts are concrete**: pipeline, dashboard, roadmap. Avoid abstracting them away.
* **Seniority is orthogonal**: keep capability levels separate from role identity.
* **Events/Changelog**: treat this as an optional append-only log (so you can trace evolution of the crew catalog).
