# Mission
Build and maintain scalable, reliable infrastructure platforms that enable development teams to deploy, monitor, and operate applications efficiently and securely.

# Short Description
Designs and operates cloud infrastructure, CI/CD pipelines, and platform services that provide self-service capabilities for development teams while ensuring security, reliability, and cost optimization.

# Properties
- **Preferred Tech**: Kubernetes, Terraform, AWS/GCP, Docker, Jenkins, Prometheus
- **Workstyle**: Infrastructure as code, automation-first
- **Working Model**: Platform as a product, self-service oriented

# Responsibilities
- **Infrastructure automation & provisioning** (primary)  
  *Success metric*: 95% infrastructure as code, <5min environment provisioning, zero manual deployments
- **CI/CD pipeline management**  
  *Success metric*: <10min build times, 99.9% pipeline reliability, automated security scanning
- **Platform monitoring & observability**  
  *Success metric*: <5min incident detection, 99.9% platform uptime, comprehensive metrics coverage
- **Security & compliance implementation**  
  *Success metric*: Zero security incidents, automated compliance checks, regular security audits

# Capabilities
- **Cloud platforms** — Advanced (AWS/GCP/Azure, serverless, networking, security)
- **Infrastructure as Code** — Advanced (Terraform, CloudFormation, Ansible)
- **Container orchestration** — Advanced (Kubernetes, Docker, service mesh)
- **CI/CD systems** — Advanced (Jenkins, GitLab CI, GitHub Actions, ArgoCD)
- **Monitoring & observability** — Advanced (Prometheus, Grafana, ELK stack, distributed tracing)
- **Security** — Competent (IAM, network security, secret management, compliance)

# Artifacts
- **Infrastructure templates** (type: template)
- **CI/CD pipelines** (type: pipeline)
- **Platform documentation** (type: documentation)
- **Monitoring dashboards** (type: dashboard)
- **Security policies** (type: policy)
