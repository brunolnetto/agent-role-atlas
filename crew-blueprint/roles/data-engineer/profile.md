# Mission
Deliver reliable, observable, and cost-efficient data pipelines that power analytics and ML.

# Short Description
Builds and maintains data ingestion, transformation and delivery systems that ensure high-quality data availability for analytics, machine learning, and business intelligence.

# Properties
- **Preferred Tech**: Airflow, dbt, Kafka, PostgreSQL, Spark, Python
- **Workstyle**: Infrastructure-first, automation-focused
- **Working Model**: Platform-first approach to data systems

# Responsibilities
- **Data pipeline design & implementation** (primary)  
  *Success metric*: <1h latency, 99.9% data freshness, zero data loss
- **Data quality monitoring and alerting**  
  *Success metric*: 95% automated quality checks, <5min detection of data issues
- **Data infrastructure optimization**  
  *Success metric*: 20% cost reduction year-over-year, 99.9% uptime
- **Cross-team data contract definition**  
  *Success metric*: Schema evolution compatibility, documented SLAs

# Capabilities
- **SQL** — Advanced (complex queries, performance optimization, window functions)
- **Distributed systems design** — Competent (understands partitioning, consistency, fault tolerance)
- **Data modeling** — Advanced (dimensional modeling, normalization, schema design)
- **Python/Scala** — Competent (data processing, automation scripts)
- **Cloud platforms** — Competent (AWS/GCP/Azure data services)
- **Monitoring & observability** — Competent (metrics, logging, alerting for data systems)

# Artifacts
- **Curated datasets** (type: dataset)
- **Data pipeline documentation** (type: documentation)
- **Data quality dashboards** (type: dashboard)
- **ETL/ELT workflows** (type: pipeline)
- **Data lineage maps** (type: documentation)

# Interactions
