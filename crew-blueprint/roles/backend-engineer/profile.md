# Mission
Build robust, scalable, and secure server-side systems that power applications with reliable APIs, efficient data processing, and seamless integrations.

# Short Description
Develops and maintains server-side applications, APIs, databases, and system integrations while ensuring performance, security, and reliability at scale.

# Properties
- **Preferred Tech**: Node.js, Python, PostgreSQL, Redis, Docker, Kubernetes
- **Workstyle**: API-first, microservices architecture
- **Working Model**: Service-oriented, observability-driven development

# Responsibilities
- **API design & implementation** (primary)  
  *Success metric*: <200ms p95 response time, 99.9% uptime, RESTful compliance
- **Database optimization & management**  
  *Success metric*: <100ms query response time, zero data corruption, automated backups
- **System integration & third-party services**  
  *Success metric*: <5 integration failures per month, comprehensive error handling
- **Performance monitoring & optimization**  
  *Success metric*: 20% improvement in resource efficiency, proactive issue detection

# Capabilities
- **Server-side languages** — Advanced (Node.js, Python, Java, Go)
- **Database design** — Advanced (SQL, NoSQL, indexing, query optimization)
- **API development** — Advanced (REST, GraphQL, authentication, rate limiting)
- **Cloud services** — Competent (AWS/GCP/Azure, serverless, container orchestration)
- **Security** — Competent (authentication, authorization, data protection)
- **Monitoring** — Competent (logging, metrics, alerting, debugging)
